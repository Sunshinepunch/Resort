# Skull Island Resort
_by Becket Harvey_

## Project Description:
A series of HTML links that advertise the fictional Skull Island Resort  
&nbsp;


## Technologies Used
* CSS
* Gitbash
* Github
* VSCode

## Longer Description
I wanted to make the base of a project I can continue to work on as I learn more in order to showcase some level of humor and CSS skills within my portfolio. This README will be updated as additional features are added.

## Complete Setup/Installation Instructions
You just gotta download the file from github - git clone away my friends https://github.com/Sunshinepunch/Resort

## Known Bugs
Nothing so far - just bad image centering and an ugly backdrop
